# JPEG Decoder
*This is a work in progress*

**A program that can decode the JPEG binary:**

ㅤㅤ•ㅤwritten in plain C with no image libraries (only standard libraries like <stdio.h>)

ㅤㅤ•ㅤreads header and compressed image data straight from the JPEG binary data

ㅤㅤ•ㅤsaves header data to custom data types and decodes some important ones (DHT, DQT)
